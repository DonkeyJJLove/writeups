## Introduction

[Back to Top](#fileless-malware-in-windows-systems-technical-analysis-and-insights)

Fileless malware has emerged as a sophisticated threat in the cybersecurity landscape. Unlike traditional malware, it resides in the system's memory, making it challenging to detect using conventional antivirus solutions. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of fileless malware in Windows systems, exploring the techniques used by attackers, the Windows functions they exploit, and case studies that illustrate their methods.

## Understanding Fileless Malware

[Back to Top](#fileless-malware-in-windows-systems-technical-analysis-and-insights)

### Definition and Characteristics

Fileless malware operates without leaving a footprint on the disk. It exploits legitimate system tools and resides in the memory, leveraging native Windows functionalities to execute malicious code.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **No Disk Presence:** Avoids writing files to disk.
- **Uses Legitimate Tools:** Exploits trusted Windows components.
- **Memory-Resident:** Operates primarily in RAM.
- **Difficult Detection:** Evades traditional signature-based detection methods.

### Common Techniques Used

- **In-Memory Code Injection**
- **Abuse of Scripting Languages (e.g., PowerShell)**
- **Exploitation of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**
- **Reflective DLL Injection**

#### `VirtualAlloc` and `VirtualAllocEx`

- **Purpose:** Allocate or reserve memory in a process's virtual address space.
- **Usage by Malware:** Allocate executable memory regions to store and run malicious code.

[Detailed Analysis](#virtualalloc-and-virtualallocex)

#### `VirtualProtect` and `VirtualProtectEx`

- **Purpose:** Change the protection on a region of committed pages.
- **Usage by Malware:** Modify memory permissions to execute code in previously non-executable regions.

[Detailed Analysis](#virtualprotect-and-virtualprotectex)

### Thread Management Functions

#### `CreateThread` and `CreateRemoteThread`

- **Purpose:** Create a new thread within the calling process or a remote process.
- **Usage by Malware:** Execute malicious code within a new thread, often in another process.

[Detailed Analysis](#createthread-and-createremotethread)

#### `RtlUserThreadStart`

- **Purpose:** Internal function used to start execution of a new thread in user mode.
- **Usage by Malware:** Indirectly involved when malware creates threads at a lower level.

[Detailed Analysis](#rtluserthreadstart)

### Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

- **Purpose:** Provides infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows.
- **Usage by Malware:** Execute code, move laterally within networks, and maintain persistence.

[Detailed Analysis](#windows-management-instrumentation-wmi)

### PowerShell and .NET Framework

- **Purpose:** Scripting language and framework for task automation and configuration.
- **Usage by Malware:** Execute scripts and commands in memory, download and run code without touching the disk.

## Mechanisms of In-Memory Code Execution

[Back to Top](#fileless-malware-in-windows-systems-technical-analysis-and-insights)

### Code Injection Techniques

#### Reflective DLL Injection

- **Concept:** Load a DLL from memory rather than disk.
- **Process:**
  1. Allocate memory using `VirtualAlloc`.
  2. Copy DLL into memory.
  3. Adjust memory protections with `VirtualProtect`.
  4. Execute the DLL's entry point.

#### Process Hollowing

- **Concept:** Replace the code of a legitimate process with malicious code.
- **Process:**
  1. Create a suspended process.
  2. Unmap the original executable from memory.
  3. Map malicious code into the process's memory space.
  4. Resume process execution.

### Execution via Scripting Engines

#### PowerShell Scripts

- **Usage:** Run malicious commands and scripts directly in memory.
- **Techniques:**
  - Use `Invoke-Expression` to execute code.
  - Obfuscate scripts to avoid detection.
  - Load assemblies using `System.Reflection`.

[Learn More](#powershell-scripts)

#### WMI-Based Execution

- **Usage:** Leverage WMI for code execution and persistence.
- **Techniques:**
  - Create WMI event subscriptions.
  - Execute commands on remote systems.

### Powershell Empire

#### Mechanism of Action

- **Description:** An open-source post-exploitation framework.
- **Key Features:**
  - Executes PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe.
  - Uses encrypted communications.
  - Operates in memory, avoiding disk writes.

[Detailed Analysis](#powershell-empire-mechanism)

### Operation Cobalt Kitty

#### Attack Overview

- **Perpetrators:** APT group known as OceanLotus or APT32.
- **Targets:** Enterprises in Southeast Asia.
- **Objectives:** Long-term espionage and data exfiltration.

[Detailed Analysis](#operation-cobalt-kitty-attack-overview)

#### Technical Analysis

- **Initial Infection Vector:** Spear-phishing emails with malicious documents.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Fileless malware executed via PowerShell.
  - In-memory code execution using `VirtualAlloc`.
  - Persistence achieved through WMI event subscriptions.

## Relationship Between Windows Functions

[Back to Top](#fileless-malware-in-windows-systems-technical-analysis-and-insights)

### `RtlUserThreadStart` and Memory Allocation Functions

- **Interaction:** While `RtlUserThreadStart` is used internally to start threads, memory allocation functions like `VirtualAlloc` are used to prepare executable memory regions.
- **Malware Usage:** Attackers may indirectly utilize `RtlUserThreadStart` when creating threads for malicious code execution.

[Explore Relationship](#rtluserthreadstart-and-memory-allocation-functions)

### Implementing Threads in .NET

- **.NET Framework:** Provides managed threading via `System.Threading.Thread`.
- **Interaction with Windows API:** Under the hood, .NET threads interact with Windows threading mechanisms.
- **Malware Implications:** Malware exploiting .NET may leverage threading to execute code in memory.
